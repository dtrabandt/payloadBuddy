# payloadBuddy

A sophisticated Go server designed to test REST client implementations with large payloads and advanced streaming scenarios. This project is specifically tailored for ServiceNow consultants and developers who need to test and troubleshoot REST consumer behavior under various network and server conditions.

## Purpose

This server helps consultants and developers:
- Simulate REST endpoints that return very large JSON payloads
- Test streaming endpoints with configurable delays and patterns
- Reproduce ServiceNow-specific scenarios (peak hours, maintenance windows, etc.)
- Identify and troubleshoot issues with clients that cannot handle large responses
- Train on best practices for handling large data transfers in REST APIs

## Best Practices for Large Payloads

### For Clients (ServiceNow, etc.)
- **Implement streaming parsers** instead of loading entire responses
- **Set appropriate timeouts** based on expected data sizes
- **Use pagination** when possible to reduce response sizes
- **Monitor memory usage** during large data processing
- **Implement retry logic** with exponential backoff

### For Servers
- **Use chunked transfer encoding** for real-time streaming
- **Implement client cancellation** handling
- **Add compression** (gzip) for large responses
- **Set reasonable limits** on response sizes
- **Monitor server resources** during load testing

### ServiceNow Specific
- **Flow Actions**: Set timeout values based on expected response times
- **REST Messages**: Consider using pagination for large datasets
- **Scheduled Jobs**: Use smaller batch sizes for processing
- **Performance**: Test during peak hours with realistic data volumes
