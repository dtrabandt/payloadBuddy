# payloadBuddy

A sophisticated Go server designed to test REST client implementations with large payloads and advanced streaming scenarios. This project is specifically tailored for ServiceNow consultants and developers who need to test and troubleshoot REST consumer behavior under various network and server conditions.

## Purpose

This server helps consultants and developers:
- Simulate REST endpoints that return very large JSON payloads
- Test streaming endpoints with configurable delays and patterns
- Reproduce ServiceNow-specific scenarios (peak hours, maintenance windows, etc.)
- Identify and troubleshoot issues with clients that cannot handle large responses
- Train on best practices for handling large data transfers in REST APIs

## Features

### üöÄ **Core Endpoints**
- **/rest_payload**: Returns a REST response with a large JSON array (100,000 objects) in a single response for stress-testing REST clients
- **/stream_payload**: Advanced streaming endpoint with configurable delays, patterns, and ServiceNow simulation modes
- **/openapi.json**: Complete OpenAPI 3.1.1 specification for all endpoints
- **/swagger**: Interactive Swagger UI for API documentation and testing

### üîê **Security Features**
- **Basic Authentication**: Optional HTTP Basic Authentication with CLI control
- **Auto-generated Credentials**: Automatic username/password generation when not specified
- **Secure Implementation**: Constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
- **Documentation Access**: API documentation endpoints (`/swagger`, `/openapi.json`) remain publicly accessible even when authentication is enabled

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Advanced Streaming Features**
- **Configurable Item Count**: 1 to 1,000,000 items
- **Delay Strategies**: Fixed, Random, Progressive, Burst patterns
- **ServiceNow Scenarios**: Peak hours, maintenance windows, network issues, database load

- **Context-Aware**: Handles client cancellation gracefully
- **Real-time Streaming**: Chunked transfer encoding with configurable flush intervals

### üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**
- **Plugin System**: Easily extend with new payload handlers via `PayloadPlugin` interface
- **OpenAPI 3.1.1 Integration**: Automatic documentation generation from plugin specifications
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each handler in its own file with self-documenting capabilities
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests for all scenarios, edge cases, and API documentation

### üöÄ **CI/CD & Releases**
- **Automated Testing**: GitHub Actions run tests on every PR and push to develop
- **Cross-Platform Builds**: Automatic releases for Linux, macOS, and Windows (amd64 + arm64)
- **Quality Gates**: Code coverage (80%+), linting, security scanning, and formatting checks
- **Git-flow Integration**: Seamless workflow with feature branches, releases, and automated deployments
- **Semantic Versioning**: Professional releases with changelogs and checksums

## Use Cases

### ServiceNow Integration Testing
Perfect for testing ServiceNow REST integrations that might fail with large datasets:
- Flow Actions that timeout on large responses
- REST Message processing limits
- Memory constraints in ServiceNow instances
- Peak hour performance degradation

### Performance Testing
- Client timeout behavior under various delays
- Memory usage with large streaming responses
- Network interruption handling
- Progressive performance degradation simulation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or newer (for building from source)

### Installation Options

#### Option 1: Download Pre-built Binaries (Recommended)
Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/dtrabandt/payloadBuddy/releases):

- **Linux**: `payloadBuddy-vX.X.X-linux-amd64.tar.gz` or `payloadBuddy-vX.X.X-linux-arm64.tar.gz`
- **macOS**: `payloadBuddy-vX.X.X-darwin-amd64.tar.gz` or `payloadBuddy-vX.X.X-darwin-arm64.tar.gz`
- **Windows**: `payloadBuddy-vX.X.X-windows-amd64.zip` or `payloadBuddy-vX.X.X-windows-arm64.zip`

Extract and run:
```sh
# Linux/macOS
tar -xzf payloadBuddy-vX.X.X-linux-amd64.tar.gz
./payloadBuddy

# Windows
# Extract the .zip file and run payloadBuddy.exe
```

#### Option 2: Build from Source
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dtrabandt/payloadBuddy.git
   cd payloadBuddy
   ```
2. Build the server:
   ```sh
   go build -o payloadBuddy
   ```

#### Option 3: Install with Go
```sh
go install github.com/dtrabandt/payloadBuddy@latest
```

### Usage

#### Basic Usage (No Authentication)
Run the server:
```sh
./payloadBuddy
```

#### With Authentication
Enable basic authentication:
```sh
# Auto-generate username and password
./payloadBuddy -auth

# Use specific credentials
./payloadBuddy -auth -user=myuser -pass=mypass
```

**Note**: When authentication is enabled, API endpoints (`/rest_payload`, `/stream_payload`) require credentials, but documentation endpoints (`/swagger`, `/openapi.json`) remain publicly accessible for better developer experience.

#### Command Line Options
- `-auth`: Enable basic authentication (default: false)
- `-user=<username>`: Set username (auto-generated if not specified)

curl http://localhost:8080/openapi.json > payloadBuddy-api.json
```

**Note**: This endpoint is always publicly accessible, even when authentication is enabled.

### /swagger
Interactive Swagger UI for exploring and testing the API.

**Usage:**
1. Start the server: `./payloadBuddy` or `./payloadBuddy -auth`
2. Open your browser: `http://localhost:8080/swagger` (no authentication required)
3. Explore endpoints, view schemas, and test requests directly in your browser
4. When authentication is enabled, use the "Authorize" button in Swagger UI to enter credentials for testing protected endpoints

**Note**: The Swagger UI is always publicly accessible, even when authentication is enabled. This allows you to explore the API documentation and then authenticate within Swagger UI to test protected endpoints.

> **Note:** Replace `username:password` with your actual credentials when authentication is enabled.

## ServiceNow Testing Scenarios

### Peak Hours (`scenario=peak_hours`)
- Simulates slower response times during peak ServiceNow usage
- 200ms base delay between items
- Perfect for testing Flow Action timeouts

### Maintenance Window (`scenario=maintenance`)
- Simulates maintenance periods with periodic spikes
- 500ms base delay with 2s spikes every 500 items
- Tests resilience during ServiceNow maintenance windows

### Network Issues (`scenario=network_issues`)
- Random network delays and interruptions
- 10% chance of 0-3 second delays
- Simulates unstable network conditions

### Database Load (`scenario=database_load`)
- Progressive performance degradation
- Delay increases as more items are processed
- Simulates database performance issues under load

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```sh
go test -v
```

Tests cover:
- Basic functionality
- Parameter validation
- ServiceNow mode
- All delay strategies
- All scenarios
- Error conditions
- Performance expectations
- Authentication middleware
- Security edge cases

## Development

### Adding New Plugins
1. Implement the `PayloadPlugin` interface:
   ```go
   type MyPlugin struct{}
   
   func (m MyPlugin) Path() string { return "/my_endpoint" }
   func (m MyPlugin) Handler() http.HandlerFunc { return MyHandler }
   func (m MyPlugin) OpenAPISpec() OpenAPIPathSpec {
       return OpenAPIPathSpec{
           Path: "/my_endpoint",
           Operation: OpenAPIPath{
               Get: &OpenAPIOperation{
                   Summary: "My custom endpoint",
                   Description: "Description of what this endpoint does",
                   // ... complete OpenAPI specification
               },
           },
       }
   }
   ```

2. Register in `init()`:
   ```go
   func init() {
       registerPlugin(MyPlugin{})
   }
   ```

3. Your endpoint will automatically appear in `/openapi.json` and `/swagger`

## Best Practices for Large Payloads

### For Clients (ServiceNow, etc.)
- **Implement streaming parsers** instead of loading entire responses
- **Set appropriate timeouts** based on expected data sizes
- **Use pagination** when possible to reduce response sizes
- **Monitor memory usage** during large data processing
- **Implement retry logic** with exponential backoff

### For Servers
- **Use chunked transfer encoding** for real-time streaming
- **Implement client cancellation** handling
- **Add compression** (gzip) for large responses
- **Set reasonable limits** on response sizes
- **Monitor server resources** during load testing

### ServiceNow Specific
- **Flow Actions**: Set timeout values based on expected response times
- **REST Messages**: Consider using pagination for large datasets
- **Scheduled Jobs**: Use smaller batch sizes for processing
- **Performance**: Test during peak hours with realistic data volumes

## AI Usage Disclosure
